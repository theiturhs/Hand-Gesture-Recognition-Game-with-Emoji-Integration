# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Game-with-Emoji-Integration

This Python script utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to create a hand gesture recognition game. The game detects hand gestures captured through a webcam feed and prompts the user to mimic a randomized sequence of hand signs. It evaluates the user's performance based on the accuracy and speed of their gesture reproductions.

### Key Features

* Gesture Detection: Utilizes the MediaPipe library to accurately detect and track hand landmarks, enabling precise recognition of various gestures.
* Diverse Gestures: Recognizes a wide range of hand gestures including thumbs up, victory sign, pointing gestures, and more, adding variety and challenge to the gameplay.
* Real-time Feedback: Provides instant feedback on the user's performance, displaying the current score, elapsed time, and game status throughout the session.
* Dynamic Sequencing: Generates randomized sequences of gestures to keep the game engaging and unpredictable, encouraging repeated play and skill improvement.
* Interactive Interface: Integrates emoji symbols for a visually appealing interface, enhancing user experience and accessibility.

### Inspiration

In the midst of the widespread usage of social media during 2020, a new trend was emerged: the Gesture Challenge. Originally introduced in the early days of 2020, the Gesture Challenge gained popularity on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Participants were tasked with replicating a sequence of hand emojis that appeared on their screens, adding their own flair and creativity to the performance. The essence of the Gesture Challenge lies in its simplicity and entertainment value. Challengers must swiftly imitate the hand gestures presented to them, injecting excitement and amusement into the experience.

### How to play?

* Launch the Game: Run the script to initiate the game session.
* Follow Instructions: Mimic the displayed hand gestures as accurately and quickly as possible.
* Score Points: Earn points for each successfully replicated gesture within the allotted time.
* Complete the Sequence: Aim to complete the entire sequence of gestures to achieve the highest score.
* Game Over: Receive final feedback on your performance and compare your results with previous attempts.
